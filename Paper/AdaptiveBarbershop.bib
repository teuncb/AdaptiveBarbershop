	abstract = {A fixed, octave‐based musical scale cannot remain faithful to the consonant simple integer ratio intervals and simultaneously be modulated to all keys. It is possible to reconcile these competing criteria, however, if the notes of the scale are allowed to vary. This paper presents a method of adjusting the pitches of notes dynamically, an adaptive tuning, that maintains fidelity to a desired set of intervals and can be modulated to any key. The adaptive tuning algorithm changes the pitches of notes in a musical performance so as to maximize consonance, which is calculated based on recent perceptual work. The algorithm can operate in real time, is responsive to the notes played, and can be readily tailored to the timbre (or spectrum) of the sound. This can be viewed as a generalization of the methods of just intonation, but it can operate without specifically musical knowledge such as key and tonal center and is applicable to timbres with nonharmonic spectra as well as the more common harmonic timbres.},

	abstract = {Until recently, the world of the British barbershop singer was a self-enclosed community whose existence went largely unrecognised both by musicians involved in other genres and by the public at large. In the last few years this has started to change, chiefly due to the participation of barbershop choruses in the televised competition ‘Sainsbury's Choir of the Year’. Encouraged by the success of Shannon Express in 1994, many other choruses entered the 1996 competition, four of them reaching the televised semi-finals, and two the finals. During this increased exposure, it became apparent that television commentators had little idea of what to make of barbershoppers, indeed regarded them as a peculiar, and perhaps rather trivial, breed of performer. This bafflement is not surprising given the genre's relative paucity of exposure either in the mass media or in the musical and musicological press; the plentiful articles written by barbershoppers about their activity and its meanings are almost exclusively addressed to each other, to sustain the community rather than integrate it into wider musical life. The purpose of this paper, however, is not to follow the theme of these intra-community articles in arguing that barbershop harmony should actually be regarded as a serious and worthy art, or to explain to a bewildered world what this genre is actually about; rather, it aims to explore the way that barbershop singers theorise themselves and their activity to provide a case study in the relationship between social and musical values. That is, I am not writing as an apologist for a hitherto distinctly insular practice, but exploiting that very insularity as a means to pursue a potentially very broad question within a self-limited field of enquiry.},

Singing experiments were conducted with 24 singers of varying ability under three conditions (Normal, Masked, Imagined). Over the duration of a recording, ∼50 s, a median absolute intonation drift of 11 cents was observed. While smaller than the median note error (19 cents), drift was significant in 22\% of recordings. Drift magnitude did not correlate with other measures of singing accuracy, singing experience, or the presence of conditions tested. Furthermore, it is shown that neither a static intonation memory model nor a memoryless interval-based intonation model can account for the accuracy and drift behavior observed. The proposed causal model provides a better explanation as it treats the reference pitch as a changing latent variable.},

Previous studies have investigated aspects of singing performance such as intonation accuracy and pitch drift, treating pitch as fixed within notes, while the pitch trajectory within notes has hardly been investigated. The aim of this paper is to study pitch variation within vocal notes and ascertain what factors influence the various parts of a note. The authors recorded five soprano, alto, tenor, bass quartets singing two pieces of music in three different listening conditions, according to whether the singers can hear the other participants or not. After analysing all of the individual notes and extracting pitch over time, the authors observed the following regularities: (1) There are transient parts of approximately 120 ms duration at both the beginning and end of a note, where the pitch varies rapidly; (2) the shapes of transient parts differ significantly according to the adjacent pitch, although all singers tend to have a descending transient at the end of a note; (3) the trajectory shapes of female singers differ from those of male singers at the beginnings of notes; (4) between vocal parts, there is a tendency to expand harmonic intervals (by about 8 cents between adjacent voices); (5) the listening condition had no significant effect on within-note pitch trajectories.},

Cross validation is the most common way to establish baseline standards and make comparisons, e.g., for MIREX competitions, but a lack of labelled aligned training data has rendered it impractical. In this paper, we present a comparison of several modelling strategies for chord recognition, hiddenMarkov models (HMMs) and conditional random fields (CRFs), on a new set of aligned ground truth for the Beatles data set of Sheh and Ellis (2003). Consistent with previous work, our models use pitch class profile (PCP) vectors for audio modelling. Our results show improvement over previous literature, provide precise estimates of the performance of both old and new approaches to the problem, and suggest several avenues for future work.},

	abstract = {The Pythagoreans linked musical intervals with integer ratios, cosmic order, and the human soul. The empirical approach of Aristoxenus, based on real musicians making real music, was neglected. Today, many music scholars and researchers still conceptualize intervals as ratios. We argue that this idea is fundamentally incorrect and present convergent evidence against it. There is no internally consistent “Just” scale: a 6th scale degree that is 5:3 above the 1st is not a perfect 5th (3:2) above the 2nd (9:8). Pythagorean tuning solves this problem, but creates another: ratios of psychologically implausible large numbers. Performers do not switch between two ratios of one interval (e.g., 5:4 and 81:64 for the major third), modern studies of performance intonation show no consistent preferences for specific ratios, and no known brain mechanism is sensitive to ratios in musical contexts. Moreover, physical frequency and perceived pitch are not the same. Rameau and Helmholtz derived musical intervals from the harmonic series, which is audible in everyday sounds including voiced speech; but those intervals, like musical intervals, are perceived categorically. Musical intervals and scales, although they depend in part on acoustic factors, are primarily psychocultural entities—not mathematical or physical. Intervals are historically and culturally variable distances that are learned from oral traditions. There is no perfect tuning for any interval; even octaves are stretched relative to 2:1. Twelve-tone equal temperament is not intrinsically better or worse than Just or Pythagorean. Ratio theory is an important chapter in the history Western musical thought, but it is inconsistent with a modern evidence-based understanding of musical structure, perception and cognition.},

	abstract = {The rise of computational modeling in the past decade has led to a substantial increase in the number of papers that report parameter estimates of computational cognitive models. A common application of computational cognitive models is to quantify individual differences in behavior by estimating how these are expressed in differences in parameters. For these inferences to hold, models need to be identified, meaning that one set of parameters is most likely, given the behavior under consideration. For many models, model identification can be achieved up to a scaling constraint, which means that under the assumption that one parameter has a specific value, all remaining parameters are identified. In the current note, we argue that this scaling constraint implies a strong assumption about the cognitive process that the model is intended to explain, and warn against an overinterpretation of the associative relations found in this way. We will illustrate these points using signal detection theory, reinforcement learning models, and the linear ballistic accumulator model, and provide suggestions for a clearer interpretation of modeling results.},

The experimental paradigm was that of a controlled varied condition with a 2 (tuning systems) × 5 (interval categories) × 5 (renditions) × 2 (players) factorial design. An analysis of variance showed a nonsignificant difference between the average deviation of harmonic intonation in the two systems used.
